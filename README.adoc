== File & Streams Example

=== Introduction

This example shows how to work with files and Streams.

The example consumes generated files from a folder, splits and marshals the content
and sends the elements to an ``event`` stream. When the file is processed, it is stored
and a notification with the filename is sent to a ``archive`` stream.

=== Build

You will need to compile this example first:

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn compile
----

=== Run

The example should run if you type

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn exec:java
----

After the example is complete, you should see the logs from the different streams
and the processed files in the `test/store' folder.

=== Contributions & Suggestions

If you stumble with this project and it helps you, good :) 

If you see a problem or an improvement with the resolution, I am open to talk, learning never ends.
